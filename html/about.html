   <h1 class="larger-size">&lt; hobbies &gt;</h1>   

   <div class="bio">
      <p>In my spare time, I indulge in diverse hobbies that not only fuel my creativity but also sharpen my skills. Graphic design is a passion of mine, whether designing logos, posters, or digital illustrations, I find immense satisfaction in blending aesthetics with functionality to communicate ideas effectively. Additionally, I immerse myself in artwork and painting, finding it both therapeutic and inspiring. Each piece is a journey and a way to explore different techniques and perspectives. This creative outlet not only enhances my artistic abilities but also fosters patience, attention to detail, and a keen eye for visual composition.</p>
      <p>Beyond artistic endeavors, I thrive in leadership roles within college organizations. As a president of the University of Cincinnati's IEEE branch, I've honed my ability to manage teams, coordinate events, and cultivate a vibrant community among peers. This experience has taught me valuable lessons in teamwork, communication, and strategic planning, which I apply both in my academic pursuits and personal interests.</p>
